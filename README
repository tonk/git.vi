vi and git combiner editor

Usage: git.vi [-h] [-a] [-m "message"] file <file> ...

Options:
	-h  Display this message

	-a  All files will be committed with the same commit message.
	    This message is the first file to be edited.

	-m  All files will be committed with the same commit message.
	    This message should be supplied on the command line.

This program works best when used with git filters, such as the
'git-edit' filter.

See my blog on how to use this (http://tonkersten.com)

	Examples:
		git.vi -m "Changed the version number" *.cfg
	or
		git.vi -a *.cfg

If both the '-m' and '-a' option are given, the '-m' has precedence.

with "git config gitvi.umask 007" the umask for this development tree can be
set. Of course it's possible to set another umask, this is just an example.
